Mini-URL-Restify
======
In this App, the user is able to shorten URLs using Database mapping.

User will be able to specify the Mini URL. (Limited by availability)

All Mini URLs will have a (configurable) expiration time-frame. This will get refreshed on accessing the Mini URL.

The Expired Mini URL's clean-up is set on a (configurable) interval. By default, is set to trigger only once per start-up.

Limitations:
 - Duplicated URL can be added to the Database.
 - Front-end not yet implemented.
 - No auth required to access any URL
 - Due to the relative short length of the MiniURL, a User could Brute Force the MiniURLs.
